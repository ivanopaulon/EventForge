# SQL Server Logging Fix - Quick Summary

## The Problem

The server logger was only writing to files, not to the SQL Server database, even though the connection string was correct.

## Root Cause

The bug was in `ServiceCollectionExtensions.cs`, method `AddCustomSerilogLogging`:

```csharp
// BEFORE (BUGGY CODE)
try {
    loggerConfiguration.WriteTo.MSSqlServer(...);  // Adds SQL sink to config
    Log.Logger = loggerConfiguration.CreateLogger();
    Log.Information("SQL Server logging configured");
} catch (Exception ex) {
    // BUG: Configuration still has SQL sink attached!
    Log.Logger = loggerConfiguration.CreateLogger();  // Still tries to use SQL!
    Log.Warning("Cannot connect to database");
}
```

**The Issue**: `WriteTo.MSSqlServer()` modifies the configuration object. If the connection fails during logger creation, the catch block creates a logger from the same configuration that still has the SQL sink attached.

## The Fix

Test the connection BEFORE adding the sink:

```csharp
// AFTER (FIXED CODE)
try {
    // Step 1: Test connection FIRST
    using (var connection = new SqlConnection(logDbConnectionString)) {
        connection.Open();
    }
    
    // Step 2: Connection OK - add SQL sink
    loggerConfiguration.WriteTo.MSSqlServer(...);
    Log.Logger = loggerConfiguration.CreateLogger();
    Log.Information("SQL Server logging configured");
} catch (Exception ex) {
    // Step 3: Connection failed - create logger WITHOUT SQL sink
    Log.Logger = loggerConfiguration.CreateLogger();
    Log.Warning("Cannot connect to database");
}
```

## Results

### When SQL Server is Available ✅
- Connection test passes
- SQL sink is added
- Logs written to: Database ✅, File ✅, Console ✅

### When SQL Server is NOT Available ✅
- Connection test fails
- SQL sink is NOT added
- Logs written to: File ✅, Console ✅ (no database attempts)

## Benefits

1. **Clean Fallback**: When database is down, logger only uses file + console
2. **Better Performance**: No continuous failed connection attempts
3. **Reliable Logging**: Logs always available on file even if database is down
4. **No Breaking Changes**: Works exactly as expected when SQL Server is available

## Testing

✅ Build: Successful  
✅ Tests: 213/213 passed  
✅ Manual test: Fallback works correctly when SQL Server unavailable

## Files Changed

- `EventForge.Server/Extensions/ServiceCollectionExtensions.cs` (9 lines added)
- `FIX_SQL_SERVER_LOGGING_BUG.md` (detailed documentation in Italian)
