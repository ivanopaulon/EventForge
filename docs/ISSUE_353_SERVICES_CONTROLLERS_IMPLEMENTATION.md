## Services Implemented

### 1. BrandService
**Location:** `EventForge.Server/Services/Products/BrandService.cs`
**Interface:** `EventForge.Server/Services/Products/IBrandService.cs`

**Capabilities:**
- Full CRUD operations for Brand entities
- Tenant isolation
- Soft delete support
- Audit logging
- Pagination support

**Methods:**
- `GetBrandsAsync(page, pageSize)` - Paginated list of brands
- `GetBrandByIdAsync(id)` - Single brand by ID
- `CreateBrandAsync(dto, user)` - Create new brand
- `UpdateBrandAsync(id, dto, user)` - Update existing brand
- `DeleteBrandAsync(id, user)` - Soft delete brand
- `BrandExistsAsync(id)` - Check brand existence

### 2. ModelService
**Location:** `EventForge.Server/Services/Products/ModelService.cs`
**Interface:** `EventForge.Server/Services/Products/IModelService.cs`

**Capabilities:**
- Full CRUD operations for Model entities
- Tenant isolation
- Brand relationship validation
- Soft delete support
- Audit logging
- Pagination support
- Filtering by brand

**Methods:**
- `GetModelsAsync(page, pageSize)` - Paginated list of all models
- `GetModelsByBrandIdAsync(brandId, page, pageSize)` - Filtered by brand
- `GetModelByIdAsync(id)` - Single model by ID
- `CreateModelAsync(dto, user)` - Create new model with brand validation
- `UpdateModelAsync(id, dto, user)` - Update existing model
- `DeleteModelAsync(id, user)` - Soft delete model
- `ModelExistsAsync(id)` - Check model existence

### 3. ProductSupplierService
**Location:** `EventForge.Server/Services/Products/ProductSupplierService.cs`
**Interface:** `EventForge.Server/Services/Products/IProductSupplierService.cs`

**Capabilities:**
- Full CRUD operations for ProductSupplier relationships
- Tenant isolation
- **Business Rule Enforcement** (see below)
- Soft delete support
- Audit logging
- Pagination support
- Multiple filtering options

**Business Rules Enforced:**

1. **Preferred Supplier Uniqueness**
   - Only one supplier per product can be marked as preferred
   - When setting a new preferred supplier, automatically resets existing preferred flag
   - Prevents data inconsistencies

2. **Bundle Supplier Restriction**
   - Bundle products (IsBundle = true) cannot have suppliers
   - Enforced during both create and update operations
   - Throws `InvalidOperationException` if violated

3. **Supplier Type Validation**
   - Suppliers must be BusinessParty with PartyType = Fornitore or ClienteFornitore
   - Validates supplier type during create and update
   - Throws `InvalidOperationException` if supplier type is invalid

**Methods:**
- `GetProductSuppliersAsync(page, pageSize)` - Paginated list of all relationships
- `GetProductSuppliersByProductIdAsync(productId)` - All suppliers for a product
- `GetProductSuppliersBySupplierIdAsync(supplierId, page, pageSize)` - All products for a supplier
- `GetProductSupplierByIdAsync(id)` - Single relationship by ID
- `GetPreferredSupplierAsync(productId)` - Get preferred supplier for a product
- `CreateProductSupplierAsync(dto, user)` - Create with business rule enforcement
- `UpdateProductSupplierAsync(id, dto, user)` - Update with business rule enforcement
- `DeleteProductSupplierAsync(id, user)` - Soft delete relationship

## Service Registration

All new services registered in `EventForge.Server/Extensions/ServiceCollectionExtensions.cs`:

```csharp
// Register product services
services.AddScoped<IProductService, ProductService>();
services.AddScoped<IBrandService, BrandService>();
services.AddScoped<IModelService, ModelService>();
services.AddScoped<IProductSupplierService, ProductSupplierService>();
```

## Error Handling

All endpoints implement comprehensive error handling:

### Validation Errors (400 Bad Request)
- Invalid input data (ModelState validation)
- Business rule violations (InvalidOperationException)
- Validation exceptions (ArgumentException)

### Not Found (404 Not Found)
- Entity not found by ID
- Preferred supplier not found

### Forbidden (403 Forbidden)
- Invalid tenant access
- Missing license feature

### Internal Server Error (500)

## Architecture Patterns Used

### Service Layer
- **Dependency Injection:** All services use constructor injection
- **Repository Pattern:** DbContext used as repository
- **Unit of Work:** EF Core SaveChanges provides transaction boundaries
- **Audit Logging:** All create/update/delete operations logged
- **Soft Delete:** IsDeleted flag instead of physical deletion
- **Tenant Isolation:** All queries filtered by TenantId

### API Layer
- **REST Principles:** Resource-based URLs, proper HTTP verbs
- **RFC7807 Problem Details:** Standardized error responses
- **Pagination:** Consistent pagination across all list endpoints
- **Versioning:** v1 API prefix
- **Documentation:** XML comments for Swagger/OpenAPI

---

## DTOs Used

All DTOs already existed from Issue #353 implementation:

### Brand DTOs
- `BrandDto` - Output DTO
- `CreateBrandDto` - Create input with validation
- `UpdateBrandDto` - Update input with validation

### Model DTOs
- `ModelDto` - Output DTO with brand name
- `CreateModelDto` - Create input with validation
- `UpdateModelDto` - Update input with validation

### ProductSupplier DTOs
- `ProductSupplierDto` - Output DTO with product and supplier names
- `CreateProductSupplierDto` - Create input with all fields
- `UpdateProductSupplierDto` - Update input with all fields

## Conclusion

The implementation successfully completes the service layer and API endpoints for Issue #353, providing a solid foundation for procurement and supplier management in EventForge. All business rules are enforced, error handling is comprehensive, and the code follows established patterns in the codebase.

**Status: Ready for Production** ✅
