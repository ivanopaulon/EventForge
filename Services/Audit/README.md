# AuditLogService Implementation for .NET 9

## Overview
This implementation provides a complete audit logging service for the EventForge application using .NET 9. The service integrates with the existing audit infrastructure (AuditableEntity and EntityChangeLog).

## Components Created

### 1. Services/Audit/IAuditLogService.cs
Interface defining the audit logging contract with methods for:
- Creating audit log entries manually
- Querying audit logs by entity, date range, user
- Automatic entity change tracking
- Flexible filtering and pagination

### 2. Services/Audit/AuditLogService.cs
Full implementation of the interface providing:
- Entity Framework Core integration
- Automatic property change detection
- Support for Insert/Update/Delete operations
- Optimized queries with proper indexing considerations

### 3. Database Integration
- Added EntityChangeLog DbSet to EventForgeDbContext
- Service registration in dependency injection container
- Integration with existing audit entities

## Build Requirements

**IMPORTANT**: This project requires .NET 9 SDK to build and run.

### Current Issue
The build environment has .NET 8 SDK but the project correctly targets .NET 9:
```
Error NETSDK1045: The current .NET SDK does not support targeting .NET 9.0
```

### Resolution Steps
1. Install .NET 9 SDK from: https://aka.ms/dotnet/download
2. Verify installation: `dotnet --version` should show 9.x.x
3. Build the project: `dotnet build`

## Usage Examples
See `Services/Audit/AuditLogServiceExample.cs` for detailed usage patterns.

## Integration
The service is automatically registered in the DI container via `ServiceCollectionExtensions.AddConfiguredDbContext()` and can be injected into any component that needs audit logging functionality.
