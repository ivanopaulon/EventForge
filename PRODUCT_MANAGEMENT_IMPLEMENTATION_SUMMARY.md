## üìã Additional Product-Related Entities

Based on the `ANALISI_ENTITA_PRODUCT.md`, there are several other entities related to Product. However, these are typically managed **as part of the Product entity** rather than standalone entities:

### 3. ProductCode (Codici Alternativi)
**Current Status:** ‚ùå No standalone management page

**Description:** Alternative codes (SKU, EAN, UPC, etc.) for products

**Recommendation:** These are best managed from the Product detail page as they are always associated with a specific product. A standalone management page would be less useful.

**Typical Usage:**
- When editing a product, add/edit/delete product codes
- View product codes in the product detail view

**If Standalone Page Needed:**
- Would require Product selection
- Fields: Product, CodeType, Code, AlternativeDescription, Status

---

### 4. ProductUnit (Unit√† di Misura Prodotto)
**Current Status:** ‚ùå No standalone management page

**Description:** Alternative units of measure for products with conversion factors

**Recommendation:** These are best managed from the Product detail page as they define product-specific measurement units.

**Typical Usage:**
- When editing a product, define alternative units (Pack, Pallet, etc.)
- Set conversion factors (e.g., 1 Pack = 6 pieces)

**If Standalone Page Needed:**
- Would require Product and Unit of Measure selection
- Fields: Product, UnitOfMeasure, ConversionFactor, UnitType, Status

---

### 5. ProductSupplier (Fornitore Prodotto)
**Current Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è Service created, but no UI

**Service Files Created:**
- `EventForge.Client/Services/IProductSupplierService.cs`
- `EventForge.Client/Services/ProductSupplierService.cs`

**Description:** Relationship between products and suppliers with pricing and delivery information

**Recommendation:** Could be useful as standalone page OR as part of Product detail

**Use Cases:**
1. **Standalone Page:** View all product-supplier relationships, filter by supplier or product
2. **Product Detail:** Manage suppliers for a specific product
3. **Supplier Detail:** View all products supplied by a specific supplier

**Fields:**
- Product (required, FK)
- Supplier (required, FK to BusinessParty)
- SupplierProductCode (optional)
- PurchaseDescription (optional)
- UnitCost (optional)
- Currency (optional)
- MinOrderQty (optional)
- IncrementQty (optional)
- LeadTimeDays (optional)
- LastPurchasePrice (optional)
- LastPurchaseDate (optional)
- Preferred (boolean)
- Notes (optional)

---

### 6. ProductBundleItem (Componenti Bundle)
**Current Status:** ‚ùå No standalone management page

**Description:** Components of product bundles (product composition)

**Recommendation:** These should ONLY be managed from the Product detail page when `IsBundle = true`.

**Typical Usage:**
- When creating/editing a bundle product, add component products with quantities
- View bundle composition in product detail view

**Fields:**
- BundleProduct (required, FK to Product)
- ComponentProduct (required, FK to Product)
- Quantity (required, 1-10,000)

## üéØ Recommendations

### Priority 1: ‚úÖ DONE
- [x] Brand Management - **COMPLETED**
- [x] Model Management - **COMPLETED**

These are the most important standalone entities that users manage independently.

### Priority 2: Optional Standalone Pages
- [ ] ProductSupplier Management - Could be useful for:
  - Viewing all product-supplier relationships
  - Managing supplier pricing across products
  - Analyzing supplier coverage

### Priority 3: Integrate into Product Management
The following should be managed as part of the Product detail/edit interface:
- ProductCode (alternative codes for the product)
- ProductUnit (alternative units of measure)
- ProductBundleItem (components of a bundle)

These entities don't make sense as standalone pages because they are always tied to a specific product.

## üîß Technical Implementation Notes

### Server-Side (Already Complete)
All entities have:
- ‚úÖ Entity definitions in `EventForge.Server/Data/Entities/Products/`
- ‚úÖ DTOs (Create, Update, Read) in `EventForge.DTOs/Products/`
- ‚úÖ Server services in `EventForge.Server/Services/Products/`
- ‚úÖ Controller endpoints in `ProductManagementController`

### Client-Side Pattern Used
All implementations follow these patterns:
1. **Service Layer**: `IEntityService` + `EntityService` using `IHttpClientService`
2. **Drawer Component**: Three modes (Create, Edit, View) using `EntityDrawer` base
3. **Management Page**: List with search/filter, ActionButtonGroup, MudTable
4. **Navigation**: Added to NavMenu under Administration section
5. **Translations**: Complete Italian translations in `i18n/it.json`

### Endpoints Available
- `/api/v1/product-management/brands` - ‚úÖ Used
- `/api/v1/product-management/models` - ‚úÖ Used
- `/api/v1/product-management/product-suppliers` - ‚ö†Ô∏è Service created, no UI
- `/api/v1/product-management/products/{id}/codes` - ‚ùå No standalone page
- `/api/v1/product-management/products/{id}/units` - ‚ùå No standalone page
- Products have methods for managing bundle items - ‚ùå No standalone page

---

## üìù Next Steps Recommendations

### Option A: Complete Standalone Pages (if needed)
If you want standalone management for all entities:
1. Create ProductSupplierDrawer + ProductSupplierManagement page
2. Create ProductCodeDrawer + ProductCodeManagement page
3. Create ProductUnitDrawer + ProductUnitManagement page
4. Create ProductBundleItemDrawer + ProductBundleItemManagement page

### Option B: Integrate into Product Detail (Recommended)
Enhance the Product management interface to include:
1. Product detail view/edit page
2. Tabs or sections for:
   - Alternative Codes (ProductCode)
   - Alternative Units (ProductUnit)
   - Suppliers (ProductSupplier)
   - Bundle Components (ProductBundleItem - if IsBundle)

### Option C: Hybrid Approach
- ProductSupplier: Standalone page (useful for supplier analysis)
- ProductCode, ProductUnit, ProductBundleItem: Integrate into Product detail
