# Navigation Menu Width Fix - Issue Resolution

## Problem Statement
The navigation menu (sidebar/drawer) in the EventForge client application was too narrow for long Italian text labels, causing text to wrap to multiple lines and creating a poor user experience.

## Solution Implemented
Increased the navigation drawer width from 240px (MudBlazor default) to 280px, which is within Material Design guidelines (256-320px for standard navigation drawers) and provides adequate space for Italian language labels.

## Changes Made

### 1. NavMenu.razor.css
- Added explicit drawer width styling: `280px` for all breakpoints
- Implemented responsive design for mobile, tablet, and desktop
- Enhanced nav-item styling:
  - Changed `height: 3rem` to `min-height: 3rem` for flexibility
  - Added `line-height: 1.4` for better text readability
  - Added `padding: 0.5rem 1rem` for comfortable spacing
  - Enabled graceful text wrapping with `white-space: normal` and `word-wrap: break-word`
- Added text wrapping support for edge cases with `overflow-wrap` and `word-break`
- Ensured MudNavMenu and nav groups take full drawer width
- Optimized nav link padding to `0.5rem 1rem` with `min-height: 48px` (accessibility compliance)
- Improved icon spacing with `margin-right: 0.75rem`

### 2. MainLayout.razor.css
- Updated sidebar width from `250px` to `280px` to match the drawer width

## Material Design Compliance
The chosen width of 280px follows Material Design 3 guidelines:
- Reference: https://m3.material.io/components/navigation-drawer/specs
- Standard navigation drawers: 256-320px
- Our implementation: 280px (middle of the recommended range)

## Benefits
1. **No Text Wrapping**: Italian labels now fit comfortably on a single line
2. **Better Readability**: Increased spacing and proper line-height improve text readability
3. **Accessibility**: Minimum 48px height ensures touch-friendly targets
4. **Responsive**: Works well on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices
5. **Material Design Compliant**: Follows industry best practices
6. **Graceful Degradation**: Text wrapping support for extremely long labels

## Testing Recommendations
1. Test on mobile devices (< 640px width)
2. Test on tablets (641px - 1024px width)
3. Test on desktop (> 1025px width)
4. Verify Italian labels don't wrap
5. Check accessibility with screen readers
6. Test with different theme variations (light, dark, warm, cool, etc.)

## Future Considerations
If labels are still too long in some cases:
1. Consider using abbreviations or shorter labels
2. Implement tooltips for full label text
3. Allow configurable drawer width in user settings
4. Use icon-only mode with tooltips for very narrow screens

## Technical Notes
- Used `::deep` selector to target MudBlazor components
- Used `!important` flag to ensure styles override MudBlazor defaults
- Maintained all existing functionality and theme support
- No breaking changes to existing code
