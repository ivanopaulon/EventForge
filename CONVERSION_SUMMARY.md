- VatNumber (Partita IVA)
- SdiCode (Codice SDI)
- PEC (Posta Elettronica Certificata)
- Notes (multi-line)

**Lines Added**: ~334 lines

### 3. SupplierManagement.razor
**Purpose**: Removed BusinessPartyDrawer dependency

**Changes**:
- Removed `<BusinessPartyDrawer>` component reference
- Removed state variables: `_supplierDrawerOpen`, `_supplierDrawerMode`, `_selectedSupplier`
- Removed handler methods: `OpenCreateSupplierDrawer()`, `OnSupplierCreated()`, `OnSupplierUpdated()`, `ViewSupplier()`

- Changed `EditCustomer()` to navigate to `/business/customers/{id}`
- Updated ActionButtonGroup: `ShowView="false"`, `OnCreate="@CreateCustomer"`

**Lines Removed**: ~60 lines

## Pattern Consistency

All Management pages now follow the same pattern:

1. **Create Action**: Navigate to `/{route-base}/new`
2. **Edit Action**: Navigate to `/{route-base}/{id}`
3. **No View Action**: Edit serves both viewing and editing purposes
4. **ActionButtonGroup**: `ShowView="false"`, `ShowEdit="true"`
5. **Navigation**: Uses `NavigationManager.NavigateTo()`
6. **State Management**: Detail pages handle their own state

## Benefits of This Conversion

### User Experience
- ✅ Full page space for editing complex entities
- ✅ Browser back button works naturally
- ✅ Direct URL access to entity details
- ✅ Bookmarkable entity pages
- ✅ Better mobile experience

### Developer Experience
- ✅ Simpler component hierarchy
- ✅ Less state management in list pages
- ✅ Easier to test and debug
- ✅ Consistent pattern across all management pages
- ✅ Reduced coupling between components

### Technical Benefits
- ✅ Better performance (no drawer overlay rendering)
- ✅ Cleaner separation of concerns
- ✅ Easier to implement lazy loading
- ✅ Better SEO potential

## Build Verification

✅ **Full solution builds successfully**
- 0 Errors
- 208 Warnings (all pre-existing, unrelated to this work)

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Navigation Testing**
   - Verify "Create" button navigates to `/new` routes
   - Verify "Edit" button navigates to `/{id}` routes
   - Verify back button navigates to list page
   - Test browser back/forward buttons

2. **CRUD Operations**
   - Test creating new entities
   - Test editing existing entities
   - Test saving changes
   - Test validation errors

3. **State Management**
   - Test unsaved changes detection
   - Test navigation away with unsaved changes
   - Test save/discard/cancel options in confirmation dialog

4. **Cross-Entity Testing**
   - Test Supplier creation and editing
   - Test Customer creation and editing
   - Verify Product detail page still works
   - Verify all other Detail pages still work

## Compliance with DRAWER_TO_PAGE_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md

✅ All conversions follow the established pattern from the migration guide:
- Dedicated Detail pages with proper routes
- Unsaved changes tracking
- Navigation confirmation dialogs
- Form validation
- Consistent UI/UX across all pages

## Notes

- **AuditHistoryDrawer**: Retained in all Management pages as per policy
- **ProductDrawer**: Still exists in `Shared/Components` for backward compatibility but not used in ProductManagement
- **BusinessPartyDrawer**: Still exists in `Shared/Components` for backward compatibility but not used in Supplier/CustomerManagement
- **URL Structure**: Maintains RESTful conventions (`/resource/new`, `/resource/{id}`)

## Future Considerations

- Consider removing unused drawer components after verifying no other pages use them
- Consider adding tabs to BusinessPartyDetail for Addresses, Contacts, References (as suggested in migration guide)
- Consider implementing delete functionality in detail pages (currently only in list pages)

---

**Conversion Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE - 100%**

All management pages now use the page navigation pattern instead of drawers for entity CRUD operations.
