## Conclusion

Issues #542 and #539 have been successfully addressed:

**Issue #539** ✅ **COMPLETE**
- All unused drawers deprecated
- Comprehensive documentation created
- Clear migration paths defined

**Issue #542** ✅ **PILOT COMPLETE**
- Enhanced fullscreen dialog created
- Pilot migration successful
- Migration guide provided
- Remaining work documented

The foundation is in place for completing the full migration. The pilot implementation demonstrates the pattern works well, and the migration guide provides clear instructions for applying it to the remaining pages.
